## Hi there 👋 I'm Michael

### I'm not a native developer

... but a lazy IT-guy and in my free time a smart-home enthusiast 🏠 so before I do a task several times, I automate it 🤓

I'm used to use [ansible](https://github.com/ansible), [python](https://github.com/python) and other script languages for automation tasks by day.

By night you'll find me doing stuff for the [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) project and also some custom projects around home automation and home assistant (_see my pinned repositories below_)
